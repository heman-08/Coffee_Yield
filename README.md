Hey there!
This is the coffee yield prediction using agro-ecological factors
Agro-ecological factors includes biotic, abiotic and agronomic factors in which the dataset is merged all together.
I've splitted the dataset into 3 groups namely group 1 ,2 and 3 and made sure that no factors are left behind.
You can try this out by downloadig the dataset(group-1) where it has varities namely C*R, Sln3 and Sln5B.
